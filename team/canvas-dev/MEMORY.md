# Canvas Dev Memory

## 2025-02-05
- Resuming Canvas component implementation after interruption. Need to rebuild Canvas.tsx and associated components (CanvasElement, SelectionBox, AlignmentGuides) with drag/resize/selection/alignment features.
- Rebuilt Canvas component suite with drag, resize, marquee selection, snapping guides, and pan/draw interactions. Refactored App shell to use layout components + toolbar and wired keyboard shortcuts for delete/copy/paste/undo/tools.
