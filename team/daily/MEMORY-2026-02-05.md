## Completed
- Multi-keyframe canvas now mirrors Figma: frames (display states) lined up horizontally in one canvas; frame size presets sync with Live Preview + Inspector; PRD updated to capture functional vs display states and component-level state machines.
- Interaction Manager UI now wired to real transition data: state graph nodes/edges, transition selection reflecting in Inspector, placeholder timeline rows; build & push done (commit b7d540f).
- High-fidelity Figma mock refreshed via remote plugin to match latest PRD (Live Preview left, multi-frame canvas center, state graph below, inspector right). 

## In Progress
- Awaiting dev-agent confirmation after latest Interaction Manager changes (monitor for follow-up tasks once merged).
- Continue coordinating figma-design-agent for any additional annotations or new views needed.

## Next
- Review merged changes, plan next Interaction Manager iterations (transition editing, component states, triggers UI).
- Keep Live Preview / Inspector polished per PRD (component panel, functional vs display state toggles).
